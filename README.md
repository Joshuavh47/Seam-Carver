# Seam Carver
Seam Carver is a homework assignment from my Data Structures class. Seam Carver takes in a picture file and calculates a the path of lowest energy using Dynamic programming (Dijkstra's algorithm,) and can use this to carve out low-energy seams in the input file resulting in an image that is smaller in dimension, but extremely similar to the original file. This project uses the Picture class from (Princeton's standard Java library)[https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/Picture.java].
